## Weekly Stand-ups: Wednesday @ 6pm MST
## Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
* Empowering users to make educated media consumption choices for effective use of their time and wallet. 
* The app is designed to aggregate ratings, likes, dislikes, "currently watching" and comments; it allows you to search by genre, ratings, release date, actor, studio. It will also allow you to create playlists.

## Motivation: why are you working on this project?
* The media industry is saturated with media: television, film, miniseries, video blogs, documentaries inclusive of a range of qualities. Not only that, but access to a lot of media is now increasingly gated by streaming applications, each owning a slimmer slice of the market and charging $7 - $20/service. It's now, more than ever, that we have to be educated consumers in order to save our time and resources.

## Risks to project completion, possibly including:
 * new team
 * Communicating solely online
 * new languages - including python, bash, html and css 
 * first time deploying an operational database
 * first time delivering a production project
 * first time working with multiple developers on a single code repo
 * uncertain obstacles due to first time delivering a project of this type
 * first time leveraging API's to access data
 
Mitigation Strategy for above risks
* Weekly meetings to discuss updates and barriers
* Asana for communication and task tracking
* Setting approriate deadlines to ensure timely progress
* Leveraging skills learned in this class
## Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
I think either Scrum or Kanban will work for us:
- Scrum: We will have two week sprints and with every sprint, we will rotate roles.  We will have standups every week to go over progress and obstacles.  Asana will act as a kanban board.
