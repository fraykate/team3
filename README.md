## Weekly Stand-ups: Wednesday @ 6pm MST
## Vision statement: what would you tell potential customers?
* Empowering users to make educated media consumption choices for effective use of their time and wallet. The app is designed to aggregate ratings, likes, dislikesm, "currently watchin" and comments; it allows you to search by genre, ratings, release date, actor, studio. It might allow you to create playlists. It might allow you to follow others to see what they like, dislike, are watching.

## Motivation: why are you working on this project?
* The media industry is saturated with media: television, film, miniseries, video blogs, documentaries inclusive of a range of qualities. Not only that, but access to a lot of media is now increasingly gated by streaming applications, each owning a slimmer slice of the market and charging $7 - $20/service. It's now, more than ever, that we have to be educated consumers in order to save our time and resources.

## Risks to project completion, possibly including:
 * new team
 * new languages - including python, bash, html and css 
 * first time deploying an operational database
 * first time delivering a production project
 * first time working with multiple developers on a single code repo
 * uncertain risks due to first time delivering a project of this type
 * first time leveraging API's to access data
 
Mitigation Strategy for above risks
## Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!
- Waterfall: I don't think we should take the waterfall approach since this is a very incertain project with various risks - waterfall is meant for set and specific software requirements with high certainty of outcome.
I think either Scrum or Kanban will work for us:
- Scrum: self-organizing teams use two- to four-week iterations called sprints, and then regroup to plan the next sprint. A key feature is daily standup meetings to identify and overcome obstacles. While there are multiple roles in the scrum team, the norm is to rotate the roles over time.
- Kanban: derived from Toyotaâ€™s just-in-time manufacturing process, which in this case treats software development as a pipeline. Here the team members have fixed roles, and the goal is to balance the number of team members so that there are no bottlenecks with tasks stacking up waiting for pro- cessing. One common feature is a wall of cards that to illustrate the state of all tasks in the pipeline. 
- Hybrid: There are also hybrid lifecycles that try to combine the best of two worlds. For example, ScrumBan uses the daily meetings and sprints of Scrum but replaces the planning phase with the more dynamic pipeline control of the wall of cards from Kanban
