We are going to move forward with using SQLite as our database. 
We will use a datasource from IMDB what we will load into SQLite. 
https://datasets.imdbws.com/

We brainstormed on user generated data like:
Movie Ratings, Comments, likes

How would we deal with a changing database that is stored in github?
We should not check in changes to the database. Only changes to code. 

Chris Lescinskas showed his draft of the website in Flask. He has started using CSS to create some formatting.
