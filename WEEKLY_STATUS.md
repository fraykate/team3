We are going to move forward with using SQLite as our database. 
We will use a datasource from IMDB what we will load into SQLite. 
https://datasets.imdbws.com/

We brainstormed on user generated data like:
Movie Ratings, Comments, likes

How would we deal with a changing database that is stored in github?
We should not check in changes to the database. Only changes to code. 

Chris Lescinskas showed his draft of the website in Flask. He has started using CSS to create some formatting.

We should prepare for our next project milestone. We should each take a page and create a card. 

Login/create user page: Pages where users can create accounts or login. <br>
User profile page: User profile information <br>
Movie results page: Results for a search <br>
Movie page: Click on a movie to go to a movie title page <br>


Kate will take the movie page and create a card for it.

We should plan to have our card completed by the 15th. <br>
We can have a wire-frame or hand drawing for next week. 

What type of tests do we need verify rendering of the page? 
- Kate posted a question on Piazza.

We moved some cards back so we can focus on the next project milestone.

Marcus - user profile <br>
