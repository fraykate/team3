We are going to move forward with using SQLite as our database. 
We will use a datasource from IMDB what we will load into SQLite. 
https://datasets.imdbws.com/

We brainstormed on user generated data like:
Movie Ratings, Comments, likes

How would we deal with a changing database that is stored in github?
We should not check in changes to the database. Only changes to code. 

Chris Lescinskas showed his draft of the website in Flask. He has started using CSS to create some formatting.

We should prepare for our next project milestone. We should each take a page and create a card. 

Login/create user page: Pages where users can create accounts or login. <br>
User profile page: User profile information <br>
Movie results page: Results for a search <br>
Movie page: Click on a movie to go to a movie title page <br>


Kate will take the movie page and create a card for it.

We should plan to have our card completed by the 15th. <br>
We can have a wire-frame or hand drawing for next week. 

What type of tests do we need verify rendering of the page? 
- Kate posted a question on Piazza.

We moved some cards back so we can focus on the next project milestone. 

Ray - login/create user page <br>
Marcus - user profile <br>
Jun - Movie results <br>
Marcus - Main page (already finished) <br>
Kate - Movie page <br>

# What we did:
We went around the table discussing the best practices for parameters and then covered the work we did for each of the individual pages.
We all completed our tasks on time in order to submit our Project Milestone 4 in a timely manner.

Marcus set us up with the PAGE_TESTING.MD doc and completed the User profile page framework.
Ray already got started on the testing framework, completed the User login page framework.
Chris already got started on the HTML rendering for his page, completed the main page framework.
Jun worked on and completed the movie results page framework.
Kate completed the movie details page framework and took meeting minutes.

We also discussed the desired user flow:
* A User logs in on the log-in page
* They then land on the main page
* From there they can make a  genre selection which takes them to the Movie results page
* They can click on a particular result (Move/Show/Documentary) to go to a movie details page
* At any point you can navigate home or to your profile page


# What we plan to do:
Next actions are to revise and clean up submissions for Project Milestone 4 by noon MST the following day.
